Facts that we can add:
    -The name “Ghibli” refers to the Italian word for the “Hot Sahara Wind.” The name is fitting because the studio wanted to “blow new wind through the anime industry.” 
        The name also refers to Miyazaki's love for Italy and planes.
        He was inspired by the Caproni Ca.309 Ghibli, a surveillance aircraft that was designed in Italy during the Second World War.

    -Studio Ghibli produced 15 of the highest-grossing anime films in Japan.
        Although My Neighbor Totoro is arguably Ghibli’s most widely recognized film (even its logo features the lovable Totoro character), the studio’s first real success was Kiki's Delivery Service.
        First screened in 1989, it was a number one hit in Japanese theaters that year. 
        Three years later in 1992, Porco Rosso topped Disney’s Beauty and the Beast at the Japanese box office. Then in 2003, Ghibli’s iconic Spirited Away became the first non-English-language film to win the Oscar for Best Animated Film. 
        The first film to gross $200,000,000 before opening in the U.S., Spirited Away became the highest grossing film ever released in Japan.

    -In 1988, Ghibli released Grave of the Fireflies. 
        One of the studio’s most profoundly beautiful works, it was based on Akiyuki Nosaka's heartbreaking semi-autobiographical short story of two children struggling to survive during WWII.
        Surprisingly, the film was only moderately successful at the Japanese box office as it was deemed too jarring for young audiences. 
        However, Grave of the Fireflies later received universal critical acclaim, and it even scores 100% on Rotten Tomatoes

    -Although Miyazaki announced his retirement in 2013, he shows no signs of quitting just yet.
        He came out of retirement in 2017 to work on an adaptation of the novel Earwig and the Witch by Diana Wynne Jones. 
        Additially, the legendary animator is also working a new project based on the novel by Japanese writer Genzaburō Yoshin, titled How Do You Live? 
        Set to be released in 2023, it tells the story of a young boy dealing with poverty. 
        In May 2020, Suzuki (who is now the chief producer of Studio Ghibli) announced that 60 animators are currently working on the film. 
        He said, “We are still hand-drawing everything, but it takes us more time to complete a film because we're drawing more frames.” 
        Suzuki also revealed that he had to accept a deal with Netflix in order to finance the project.

    -If you want to know more about the history of Studio Ghibli, you can visit the Ghibli Museum, located in Mitaka, Tokyo. 
        And if you’re feeling inspired to watch one of the studio’s classics, you can now stream Spirited Away, Howl’s Moving Castle, My Neighbor Totoro, and many more Ghibli films on Netflix
